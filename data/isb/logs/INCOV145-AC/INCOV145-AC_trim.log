Using an excessive number of cores has a diminishing return! It is recommended not to exceed 8 cores per trimming process (you asked for 8 cores). Please consider re-specifying
Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 2.10
Could not detect version of Python used by Cutadapt from the first line of Cutadapt (but found this: >>>#!/bin/sh<<<)
Letting the (modified) Cutadapt deal with the Python version instead
Parallel gzip (pigz) detected. Proceeding with multicore (de)compression using 8 cores

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> /labs/khatrilab/solomonb/covid/isb/temp_fastq/INCOV145-AC_R2.fastq.gz <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
Illumina	1736	AGATCGGAAGAGC	477297	0.36
smallRNA	7	TGGAATTCTCGG	477297	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	477297	0.00
Using Illumina adapter for trimming (count: 1736). Second best hit was smallRNA (count: 7)
