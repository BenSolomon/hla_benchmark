# hla_benchmark

This pre-refactor branch serves as an archive for the complete, working repo prior to refactoring filepaths and including data.
The refactor process was meant to make the repo as reproducible as possible for those who might download it

However, the raw data is contained in paths outside of the repo and many of these files are too large to transfer.
Thus, the process of transfering smaller data to the repo and refactoring file paths might not result in a fully reproducible workflow

Thus, this branch maintains the original file paths and all original data in it's place.
If there are any issues with broken paths in the refactored repo, this branch can be used to explore data and paths were connected prior to the refactor.
